        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>White water rafting is an exhilarating adventure sport that involves navigating a raft through rough, turbulent waters, typically on a river. The rapids are classified into six levels of difficulty, ranging from gentle Class I to extremely challenging Class VI. White water rafting requires a combination of paddling skills, teamwork, and strategic navigation to successfully navigate the rapids. It's an excellent way to experience nature's thrill and challenge oneself physically and mentally. Many locations around the world offer white water rafting opportunities, including the Colorado River in the United States and the Futaleufú River in Chile.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <div class="history-content">
              <p>Founded in 2000, Rafting Adventures has been providing thrilling white-water rafting experiences in the most beautiful rivers across the country.</p>
              <img src="images/happy-client.jpg" alt="Historical rafting photo">
              <p>In the early years, we focused on mastering the rapids of the Colorado River, a location known for its wild, challenging waters. Our team of experienced guides worked tirelessly to ensure that every trip was not only safe but also packed with excitement and breathtaking scenery. As word spread, we quickly became a popular choice for anyone seeking an adventure on the water.</p>
        
          <p>By 2005, we had expanded our operations to include trips on rivers across the nation. From the Snake River in Idaho to the Ocoee River in Tennessee, we began offering a variety of rafting experiences, including half-day scenic trips and more challenging multi-day excursions. Our goal was to cater to both first-timers and experienced rafters, ensuring that every person who joined us could have an incredible time.</p>
        
          <p>As our company grew, we expanded our offerings to include more specialized rafting trips, such as family-friendly adventures and corporate team-building events. We also introduced custom trips for those seeking to explore remote and less-traveled rivers. But no matter the trip, our dedication to safety, environmental stewardship, and creating memorable experiences has always remained at the heart of what we do.</p>
        
          <p>Throughout the years, we’ve built a loyal following of adventurers, and we’re proud of the reputation we’ve established for providing top-notch rafting experiences. Our team of expert guides, who are trained in first aid, CPR, and water safety, ensures that every trip is handled with the utmost care and professionalism.</p>
        
          <p>As we look forward, we’re excited to continue offering new and exciting rafting adventures. Our company has never wavered from its original mission: to share the thrill of white-water rafting with as many people as possible, while promoting environmental responsibility and a love for the great outdoors.</p>
